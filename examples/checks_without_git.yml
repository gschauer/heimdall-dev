  - name: Tests passed (100%)
    # This condition is not an expression as above. Instead, it uses another evaluator, namely govalidator.
    # The syntax is: <json.value> valid: <validator>
    # whereas <validator> is a built-in function like mail address, URL, semantic version, alphanum, regex, etc.
    # This feature demonstrates a polyglot evaluator for checks written in any language (Python, Bash, Groovy,...).
